iFrames 2.1.1 fixes the following issues with the iFrames API:

• When no API command for the input was provided, the shortcut would not automatically ask the user to select a screenshot. This has now been fixed.
• When the &passthrough command was passed, the shortcut would ignore &vGrid, &hGrid, and &autoGrid commands, this is no longer the case.
• The shortcut would not accept images passed alongside the API command, which has also been fixed.
